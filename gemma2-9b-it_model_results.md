##  LLM Performance Evaluation Plan for Olympics 2024 Social Media Data by gemma2-9b-it

This plan outlines the steps to evaluate the performance of the given LLM on preprocessed Olympics 2024 social media data. 

**1. Data Understanding:**

* **Data Source:** Identify the specific social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) and the time period of data collection.
* **Target Topics:** Define the key themes and events related to the Olympics 2024 that the LLM should be able to understand and analyze (e.g., athlete performance, medal counts, specific sports, fan reactions).
* **Data Labels:** Determine the ground truth labels for sentiment analysis, topic classification, or other relevant tasks. This could involve manual annotation by experts or using existing labeled datasets.

**2. Preprocessing (as outlined in the provided plan):**

* **Data Cleaning:**  Thoroughly clean the data by removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting spelling errors.
* **Data Normalization:** Convert text to lowercase, tokenize it, remove stop words, and apply stemming or lemmatization to ensure consistency and reduce dimensionality.
* **Data Transformation:** Extract relevant features, encode categorical variables, and vectorize text data using appropriate techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

**3. Model Evaluation:**

* **Splitting the Data:** Divide the preprocessed data into training, validation, and test sets. The training set will be used to train the LLM, the validation set for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set for final performance evaluation.
* **Metrics:** Choose appropriate metrics to evaluate the LLM's performance based on the specific tasks:
    * **Sentiment Analysis:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC (Area Under the Curve).
    * **Topic Classification:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
    * **Other Tasks:**  Depending on the specific tasks, other metrics like BLEU score (for machine translation), ROUGE score (for summarization), or perplexity (for language modeling) may be relevant.
* **Baseline Comparison:** Compare the LLM's performance to a baseline model (e.g., a simple rule-based system or a pre-trained language model without fine-tuning) to understand the LLM's added value.

**4. Analysis and Reporting:**

* **Performance Interpretation:** Analyze the results of the evaluation metrics and provide insights into the LLM's strengths and weaknesses.
* **Error Analysis:** Examine the types of errors the LLM makes to identify areas for improvement.
* **Report Generation:** Create a comprehensive report summarizing the evaluation findings, including the chosen metrics, performance results, baseline comparisons, error analysis, and conclusions.

**Tools:**

* **Python libraries:** NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch
* **Cloud-based platforms:** Google Cloud AI Platform, Amazon SageMaker

**Note:** This plan provides a general framework. The specific details of the evaluation will need to be tailored to the characteristics of the LLM, the preprocessed data, and the specific tasks of interest.
